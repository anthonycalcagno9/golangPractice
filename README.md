# Go Learning Practice

A comprehensive collection of Go programming concepts and examples organized by topic.

## Root Level (`main.go`)
- **If conditions** - Basic conditional statements
- **Statement; statement idiom** - Multiple statements on one line
- **Comma ok idiom** - Pattern for checking operation success
- **Switch case** - Switch statements and type switches
- **For loop** - All variations of Go's single loop construct

- **`018_pointers/`** - Pointer semantics, memory addresses

### üõ†Ô∏è **Advanced Topics**
- **`019_garbage-collection-stack-and-heap/`** - Memory management, escape analysis
- **`020_bcrypt/`** - Password hashing and security

## Key Go Concepts Covered

### Memory Management
- **Stack vs Heap** - Value semantics (stack) vs pointer semantics (heap)
- **Escape Analysis** - Compiler optimization for memory allocation
- **Garbage Collection** - Automatic memory cleanup

### Concurrency Patterns
- **Goroutines** - Lightweight threads
- **Channels** - Communication between goroutines
- **Select** - Non-blocking channel operations
- **Worker Pools** - Efficient job processing
- **Fan-in/Fan-out** - Advanced channel patterns
- **Context** - Cancellation and timeout management

### Type System
- **Interfaces** - Contracts and polymorphism
- **Generics** - Type-safe code reuse
- **Method Sets** - Value vs pointer receivers
- **Struct Embedding** - Composition over inheritance

### Best Practices
- Prefer composition over inheritance
- Use interfaces for flexible design
- Handle errors explicitly
- Use context for cancellation
- Favor value semantics when possible
